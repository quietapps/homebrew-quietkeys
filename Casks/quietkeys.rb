  # Build is not signed with an Apple Developer ID. Make the app launchable on
  # any Mac out of the box:
  #   1. Strip ALL extended attributes (com.apple.quarantine, com.apple.macl,
  #      com.apple.provenance) so Gatekeeper does not block launch.
  #   2. Force-register the bundle with Launch Services so double-clicking from
  #      Finder / Dock launches the real binary.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Quiet Keys is distributed unsigned. The post-install hook strips
    Gatekeeper attributes automatically, but if the app refuses to launch
    on a fresh Mac, do this once:

      1. Open Finder → /Applications
      2. Right-click "Quiet Keys.app" → Open
      3. Click "Open" in the dialog
      4. macOS remembers your choice for every future launch

    Or run this in Terminal once after install:
      xattr -cr "/Applications/Quiet Keys.app"

    Quiet Keys needs Accessibility access to hear keystrokes (listen-only,
    nothing is logged or transmitted). Grant it in System Settings →
    Privacy & Security → Accessibility when the onboarding window asks.
